## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

- I started by copying over the starter files from the project download, as well as the design files for Figma
- I initialized git and a GitHub repo and pushed the starter files
- Initialized [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

- I learned how to set up a Tailwind CSS configuration, how to use the official [Tailwind VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss), which offers intellisense, and how to set up [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) using the [prettier-plugin-tailwindcss](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss?tab=readme-ov-file) plugin. In the Prettier settings, I added ".prettierrc.js" to the "Prettier: Config Path," then created a file by the same name in the root of my project (also where my indec.html is), and included the following code:

```js
/** @type {import("prettier").Config} */

module.exports = {
  plugins: ["prettier-plugin-tailwindcss"],
};
```

...and now my classes format-on-save, which is rad.
